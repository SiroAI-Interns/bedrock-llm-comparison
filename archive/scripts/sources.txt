ANSWER:
======================================================================
Based on the provided source documents, the FDA recommends the following HbA1c targets for T2DM feasibility studies inclusion criteria:

1. The FDA recommends including patients with a minimum HbA1c > 7% to 8%, depending on the goals of the study and if it is clinically appropriate, considering potential medical device- and/or procedure-related risks. (Source 7)

2. For the upper limit, the FDA recommends that feasibility clinical studies be risk-based and not include patients with an HbA1c greater than 10%. This is because patients with an HbA1c greater than 10% are generally considered to have uncontrolled glycemia, and non-experimental treatment escalation is likely in their best interest. (Source 7)

3. The FDA also notes that some patients may have higher HbA1c targets based on complex medical history, additional risks from hypoglycemia, and/or shortened life expectancy. However, depending on the device and study design, patients who are already at their HbA1c target may not be appropriate for inclusion in a feasibility study. (Source 2)

4. The FDA recommends that the study enroll subjects who can anticipate benefit from escalation of care. Thresholds for escalation of treatment should be consistent with clinical practice guidelines. (Source 2 and Source 7)

It's important to note that these recommendations are for feasibility and early feasibility studies, and sponsors should justify the inclusion and exclusion criteria they propose for their clinical study protocol. (Source 2)

6D. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
In general, premarket study populations  in regard to disease state, health status, and potential 
comorbidities  should be representative of the patient population for which the product is 
intended. However, for feasibility  and early feasibility  studies where medical device safety and 
treatment e ffect are not yet  known, a narrow  patient population as described below may be more 
appropriate depending on the anticipated risk that the medical device and/or medical device -
related procedure(s) pose.
A common consideration for feasibility and early feasibility clinical studies examining the 
potential for improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM is that patient treatment targets  
should be met. The clinical  practice guidelines  referenced in this guidance  recommend the target  
HbA1c of < 7% or 8% , depending upon the patient’s needs. Some patients may have higher

should be met. The clinical  practice guidelines  referenced in this guidance  recommend the target  
HbA1c of < 7% or 8% , depending upon the patient’s needs. Some patients may have higher 
HbA1c targets  based upon a complex medical history, additional risks from hypoglycemia, 
and/or shortened life expectancy, but depending on the device and study de sign, patients who are 
at their HbA1c target may not be appropriate for inclusion in a feasibility study.  Sponsors should 
justify the inclusion and exclusion criteria they propose for their feasibility or early feasibility 
clinical study.
We recommend tha t you consider the following for the inclusion/exclusion criteria of your 
feasibility  and/or early feasibility  clinical study protocol:
· We recommend that the study enroll subjects who can anticipate benefit from escalation 
of care. Thresholds for escalation of treatment should be consistent with clinical practice

Surgical Complications20);
·Categorized according to whether they meet the established serious adverse event 
definitions ;21
·Assessed for resolution status ; and
·Adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee .22
If study subjects used dietary supplements or herbal preparations while under study, we 
recommend that you captur e such use, and use of these substances should be discussed in the 
study results.
H.  Effectiveness Analysis  and Data
FDA recommends that you collect medical device effectiveness23data in both early feasibility 
and feasibility  clinical studies. We recommend that you assess  change in  HbA1c as this is a  
widely recognized  objective measure of glycemic control. Reduction in HbA1c indicates 
improved glycemic control with T2DM therapy.

widely recognized  objective measure of glycemic control. Reduction in HbA1c indicates 
improved glycemic control with T2DM therapy.
We recommend that the HbA1c assay used be specified in the clinical study protocol. HbA1c 
assays do not all have the same performance characteristics, with some being more accurate than 
others. If possible , we recommend use of a National Gly cohemoglobin Standardization Program 
(NGSP) -certified assay  and/or a laboratory -based HbA1c measurement method  that has been 
well-validated for accuracy and precision .
Because rescue medications may be used for subject safety during the study, a comparison of the 
treatment arm to a parallel control arm for the number of subjects on rescue medications to 
achieve glycemic targets  can also be considered to support effectiveness. FDA considers t he 
ability to achi eve glycemic targets  with reduction in baseline diabetes medications as a benefit.

3IV. Clinical Study Recommendations
We recommend you conduct  a clinical stud y to determine the feasibility  and safety  of any new 
medical  device that is therapeutically intended to improve glycemic control in patients with 
T2DM to support initiation of further  clinical investigation  (e.g., additional feasibility or pivotal) . 
The study should generally be conducted under  the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) 
regulation, 21 CFR part 812, for studies conducted in the  U.S. Generally, we believe medical 
devices addressed by this guidance document are significant risk medical devices subject to all 
requirements of 21 CFR  part 812. See the FDA guidance titled “Significant Risk and 
Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies .”4In addition to the requirements of 21  CFR part 
812, sponsors of such trials of a medical device conducted in the U.S. must comply with

· We recommend that the study enroll subjects who can anticipate benefit from escalation 
of care. Thresholds for escalation of treatment should be consistent with clinical practice 
guidelines, as well as clinically appropriate. We recommend the inclusion of patients with 
minimum HbA1c > 7% to 8% , depending on the goals of the study and if it is clinically 
appropriate , considering potential medical device - and/or procedure -related risk.  
 
Similarly, the maximum HbA1c for enrollment should be such that further delay in non-
experimental  care, results in  risks to the study subject that outweigh the anticipated 
benefit . We recommend that the upper limit for feasibility clinical studies be risk -based  
and not more than  an HbA1c of 10%, as patients  with an HbA1c great er than 10%  are 
generally clinically considered to have uncontrolled glycemia and non -experimental 
treatment escalation is likely in the best interest of the patient .12

Specific recommendations for feasibility and early feasibility clinical studies for medical devices 
intended to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM are summarized below. These 
study recommendations reflect FDA ’s current thinking regardin g study design for medical 
devices intended  to therapeutically  improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM.
In providing these recommendations, we often refer to clinical practice guidelines for the 
management of T2DM. For the purposes of this guidance , use of the term “clinical practice 
guidelines ” collectively refers to clinical practice guidelines  from the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA),7American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE),8and the 
American College of Endocrinology (ACE).9FDA believes that the recommendations provided 
in this guidance are consistent with the recommendations made in these clinical practice 
guidelines.

·Subjects should have T2DM but be otherwise healthy  under optimal medical 
management . We recommend the following inclusion/exclusion criteria considerations  
for T2DM -related c omorbidities :
o If complications from the medical device and/or medical device -related 
procedure (s) may require surgery, subjects with medical conditions that could 
make them unsuitable for surgery or general anesthesia should be excluded.
o T2DM associated comorbidities should generally be controlled  and stable (e.g., 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy, retinopathy, 
neuropathy) , and inclusion/exclusion criteria should reflect this . For example, we 
recommend that s ubjects do not have impaired renal function; thus, an estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73  m2 is recommended . An eGF R 
below this  number is associated with subsequent risk of all -cause and cardiovascular

(IDEs) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain Firs t in Human 
(FIH) Studies .”10When consistent with the goal(s) of the study, the recommendations made in 
this document should be considered when designing an early feasibility clinical study.
The objective of a feasibility clinical study  is to gather initial safety and effectiveness data to 
support initiation of further  clinical investigation. FDA recommends that the primary endpoints 
should address safety by collection of all adverse events and effectiveness . For effectiveness, we 
recomm end assessing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) , as this is a  widely recognized  objective 
measure of glycemic control  recommended by ADA’s clinical practice guideline  and as a  
surrogate for risk of developing complications .11Other measures of effectiveness can also be 
collected by the study sponsor to help focus further device study.
